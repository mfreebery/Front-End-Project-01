    <h1 class="shrimpdaddy">How to Permanently Eradicate Poverty Simply and Deliciously</h1><br>
    <p class="pandp"><em><b>The Problem and The Plan</b></em></p><br>
    <p>How can greedy hedgefund owners and fortune 500 billionaires eat up our money if we eat it first?<br>
       You see, the problem facing the world that causes the most overall suffering is poverty. Creating socioeconamic 
       divisions in our communities, forcing elderly people on fixed incomes go hungry. Today a child goes to school hungry and 
       in soiled ragged clothes. However, when that child grows up, they will be cruel to others due to their feelings
       of social isolation, and perhaps even that child is further ostrosized 
       due to teasing and bullying. That child will grow up to be cruel and attend flat earth awarness events. If we continue to turn a blind eye to the dissapering middleclass and the constantly widening wage gap, that will be the future we face with the next generation.
       We are the lucky ones though, There are places all around you where people are sick
       and dying from malnurshment, while there are people in the world with enough money to feed millions. For
       generations. Without causing major conflict and to avoid any violent civil unrest from happening from revolution minded emotional 
       initial responses, don't you worry my dear reader. I did not present this problem and potential bleak outcome to incite panic. Quite the opposite, in fact. You can just kick back and breathe easy knowing that I have already solved everything for you.
       I literally saved the world. Matt Freebery that is, that's my name. I'm the one that saved the world.

    <p>Anyway how do I plan to end poverty and suffering you ask?</p>
